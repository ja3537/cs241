The Three Laws of Robotics:
First: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction,
   allow a human being to come to harm;
Second: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings
   except where such orders would conflict with the First Law;
Third: A robot must protect its own existence as long as
such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law;
The Zeroth Law: A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction,
    allow humanity to come to harm.
    -- Isaac Asimov, I, Robot
